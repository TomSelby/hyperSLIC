# HyperSLIC

HyperSLIC is an adaptation of the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm widely used on remote sensing images for the clustering of highdiemensional miscorsocpy datasets.

## Usage
The SLIC notebook gives an example of how the package is applied to a scanning electron diffraction (SED) dataset.
```python
import hyperSLIC
```

## Contributing

We're happy for users to use the code on their own data however please keep this repo and results confidential until publication of the algorithm (should be soon).


Feel free to raise an issue if required or you wish to see new functionality implemented.
